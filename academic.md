## Before University

<div style="text-align: justify">
Prior to getting a Bachelors Degree, I'd applied for a scholarship at <a href="https://simpleflying.com/embraer-high-school-scholarships">Embraer High School</a>, maintained by the Brazilian aircraft company. It provides high quality resources for low income students, so they can develop their personal and professional skills, consequently being accepted by great universities afterwards. 
<br><br>
During my time there I was not only prepared for Brazil's most difficult college entrance exams, but also for important topics within society, such as sustainability, critical thinking and team work.
<br><br>
Among the different projects that I took part in, these are highlights:
</div>

**Alternativas Sustentáveis** - Sustainable Alternatives

<div style="text-align: justify">
Several projects about finding ways for addressing environmental issues. In my case, my team and I worked on learning and planning a sustainable greenhouse, with proper structure and eco-friendly materials.
</div>

**Programa Pré Universitário** - Pre-University Program (Engineering)

<div style="text-align: justify">
Students chose one of three areas: Bio Science, Humanitites and Engineering. Those are general divisions that cover most of the available studies at college level, so one could get to know more about the different realms that can guide their further education.</div>

**Décadas** - Decades

<div style="text-align: justify">All students were responsible for preparing a stage show about the previous decades (50's to 90's). Scripts and rehersals were fully made by the 200 students, with support from teachers.</div>

## University Studies

<br>
<div style="text-align: justify">
In 2018, I've got a Bachelors Degree in Computer Engineering at the <a href="https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/english">University of Campinas</a>. The program consisted of 10 semesters (5 years), with focus on System and Industrial subjects. In other words, it included courses with emphasis in embedded systems and electronics.
<br><br>
I chose Computer Engineering because I've been always interested in knowing what happens inside tech devices. Also, I knew that it had a lot of potential in the future, so I would be able to help people through my skills. 
<br><br>
My first programming language was C. Then, C++ and Java. I learned Python several years later when learning about Machine Learning.
<br><br>
When I attended a course about MIPS Architecture, I was fascinated about how things worked on lower layers. The fact that everything we see in a screen is converted to 1 or 0's at some point made me more intrigued and curious about computer engineering. Then, embedded system courses started and it was so interesting to program Freescale's Freedom board, dealing with bits and different interfaces.
<br><br>
During my Bachelors Degree I could take part in different projects outside the undergraduate program.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">
The Robotics Studies Group was a great opportunity to put in practice the concepts that we were taught in the theorical courses. I was part of the Sumo Wrestling Robot, that competed in tournaments agains other student organizations, both at state and national level. We used Arduino boards and sensors, with C programming. Also, I contributed to the Robot Football team that also used Arduinos for the robots, and a camera for image processing using C++. Such project competed at the Brazilian Robotics Tournament, as well as another one that I worked on, the Lego Robot Explorer.</div>

**Enactus Unicamp**

<div style="text-align: justify">
Enactus is a global organization in which University students work on positive impact programs. Through social entrepreneurship and empowerment, these initiatives aims to implement social businesses for low income individuals.</div>

The three projects I was able to help were 14 Bis/Recicle (improving work and results at Recycles Centers), Madrepérola (business organized by seamstresses to produce bras for breast cancer patients) and PurEco (App for advertising and management of house cleaning services using eco-friendly products).</div>

**Smart Campus**

<div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 16px">
Smart Campus is an initiative from the University of Campinas admin group for implementing intelligent and autonomous systems for different university demands, using the concept of Internet of Things.
<br><br>
I was oriented by Prof. PhD Juliana Freitag Borin and had support from LMCAD (Multidisciplinary High Performance Computing Lab) to develop an IoT device for smart batteries collection on campus of Barão Geraldo (Campinas).
<br><br>
Basically, there are many collectors in the campus, but those are not filled up uniformly. Less populated areas don't usually need to be checked frequently. So the idea was to develop a prototype using a simple embedded system for checking the capacity and based on that return the best route for the collectors.
<br><br>
It was implemented using NodeMCU and a ultrasonic sensor programmed in C. The information was sent  using MQTT via Wi-Fi, giving there was no LoRA or NB-IoT network available. A web application was developed using Django, MongoDB and Google Maps API to return the best route according to the data.</div>
