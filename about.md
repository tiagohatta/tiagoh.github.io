<div style="text-align: justify">
I was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Jos%C3%A9_dos_Campos">São José dos Campos, SP - Brazil</a>. Currently, I'm living in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothenburg">Göteborg, Sweden</a>.
<br><br>
My family is originally from Japan 🇯🇵. My relatives immigrated to Brazil in the first half of the 20th century.
This wikipedia page presents some information about that phenomenon: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Brazilians#First_immigrants">Wikipedia - Japanese Brazilians</a>.
<br><br>
My dad's side came from Tokushima (徳島県) prefecture and my mom's from Fukuoka (福岡県).
<br><br>
In 2021 I adopted a kitten 🐈 called Saki (咲希) which means "Blossom of Hope".

## Current Activities

<div style="text-align: justify">
💪 <strong>Volunteering</strong>: After I arrived in Gothenburg, I sent an e-mail to the local cat shelter, <a href="https://djurensvanner.se/goteborg/">Djurens Vänner</a>, since I was interested in being a volunteer. In December of 2022 I started helping there. The job consists in a lot of cleaning and feeding the pets, but it is incredibly rewarding.
<br><br>
📚 <strong>Swedish For Immigrants</strong>: In order to integrate to Swedish society, I believe it's important to learn the native language. It's a big challenge, but I'm seeing progress in my studies.

## Hobbies

<div style="text-align: justify">
🎸 <strong>Guitar</strong>: Years ago I learned how to play the guitar. Both acoustic and electrical. It's been a while since I played it though.
<br><br>
🗣️ <strong>Language Learning</strong>: It's fascinating to me how you can express yourself to others in different part of the globe in a totally different way you're used to. After studying English for many years, I decided to start Japanese. I get the basics during my bachelors degree. I also studied Spanish in high school, and started French some time ago. However, as I moved to Sweden, my focus as of now is on Swedish.
<br><br>
🧳 <strong>Travelling</strong>: I've always wanted to travel more, but since the costs for that in my home country are quite high, I've visited cities and states closer to where I lived. Now in europe I hope to have more opportunities to check out new places. Countries I've visited: 🇧🇷, 🇦🇷, 🇸🇪, 🇫🇷, 🇮🇪 and 🇵🇱.
