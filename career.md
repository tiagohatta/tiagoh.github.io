## Internship at Motorola Mobility

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/motologo.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="motologo-img" style="display: flex" width="25%" height="25%">

In 2018 I started my internship program at Motorola. In my case I worked part-time (30h per week).

<div style="text-align: justify">
It was a great experience since the managers and software engineers there were highly qualified and also willing to contribute to my development. I was part of the WiSL team (Wireless, Sensors and Location), responsible for feature integration and bug fixing in Android smartphones. 
<br><br>
The team scope consisted of several components, namely Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Sensors (magnetometer, proximity, accelerometer - fingerprint sensor not included), NFC and Location (GNSS). We were responsible for the Operating System code from System apps, Framework, HAL and Driver layers.
<br>

    </div>
</div>

During that time, I had activities related mostly to WiFi and Location. That included log analysis and collection, discussions with end users and testing teams, and constant contact with Google and Qualcomm for support. 
<br><br>
I also learned more about product development workflow and code changes using tools such as GIT, Gerrit and Jenkins. 
<br><br>
For task management, Jira was the main tool. As for log analysis we used Bugreports, ADB, Fastboot and Wireshark. The programming languages used depended on the layers, so for vendor side it was C++, and Java for upper layers.
<br>

Since Motorola is a global company, I had constant contact with people in the US, India and China. It was the first time I had to use english on a daily basis.

</div>

## Full-time Software Engineer

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/ipelogo.jpeg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="ipelogo-img" style="display: flex " width="30%" height="30%">

<div style="text-align: justify">
After 6 months as an intern, I was hired by <a href="https://www.eldorado.org.br/en/o-eldorado/">Eldorado Research Institute (Instituto de Pesquisas Eldorado - IPE)</a> as Software Engineer. Motorola and other companies have had a long time partnership with IPE, given that the Brazilian government incentivize investments in such Research Centres in exchange of tax rate cuts.
<br><br>
For this reason I continued my work on Motorola devices and in the same team. The main differences were that it was full time and I had more responsabilities due to my previous experience. From pretty much only learning with others, I was prepared to actively contribute more to the team processes and the organization necessities.
<br><br>
The tasks continued being similar to the ones I had in my internship, so I was able to deepen my technical knowledge on 802.11 and GNSS navigation protocols, as well as AOSP Architecture. I also dealt with different product deliveries and deadlines, since the phone industry is highly competitive and many Android devices were launched per year, with most of them with at least one OS software update. Products with same chipsets were easier to manage, but the portifolio was diversified so a lot of challenges came up regularly. Amongst the different issues along the way, the most frequent ones were regarding throughput, stability (crashes), compliance with certifications and common use cases (connection, roaming, hotspot, pinpoint location).
<br><br>
At some point, the Tech Leads decided to implement an agile way of working based on concepts of SCRUM. That was extremely beneficial for everyone in terms of productivity and efficiency. With daily meetings we could directly contribute to each other's activities, weekly plannings were important to set priorities, and monthly retrospective ceremonies helped us to improve our work.

<div style="text-align: justify">
Another relevant experience during that time was the constant support and feedback between our development team and the quality assurance one. Most of the issues were reported by QA, as they had several testing plans and lots of test cases performed during the product development cycle. Many tests had to be reviewed and rewritten.
</div>

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/btlogo.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="btlogo-img" style="display: flex; float: left; margin: 30px " width="10%" height="10%">

<div style="text-align: justify">
After two years working with Wi-Fi and Location, I decided to move to the Bluetooth team, as I was motivated to learn more about it. We were responsible for both Bluetooth Classic and Low Energy, having to analyze over-the-air packets and understand how the protocol defined the communication between devices. Also, many profiles are used by Android phones, such as HFP, A2DP, HID, AVRCP, OPP, PBAP, GATT, etc. Besides common use cases for the technology, frequent issues were related to coexistance between BT and WLAN, as both can use the same frequency range (2.4 GHz), and interoperability (multiple devices and manufacturers in the market).
</div>

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/mmelogo.webp' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="mmelogo-img" style="display: flex; float: right; margin: 20px " width="20%" height="20%">

<div style="text-align: justify">
Due to my openness to learning and discovering different technologies, I was invited to support the Multimedia Audio team for one semester. It was a great opportunity as they needed more workforce and Bluetooth had a lot of interface with that component. I was able to learn more about CODECs, microphone, speakers and headphones configuration, as well as audio routing.
<br><br>
Following weeks when I started my internship at Motorola, I noticed that a lot of technical knowledge was not documented properly. Our team in Brazil was quite new compared to other countries, so capacitating people was crucial for the long run. Hence documentation was a topic considerably relevant for us.
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">
Based upon that, I started a documentation project that aimed to provide processes and insights for our team. Every person feels differently regarding this subject. Some people love producing material, others hate it. Some have the habit of doing it regularly whereas others are completely forgetful. And of course, most of them are in between. As everyone would take part in the process, we decided to use Business Model Canvas in order to cover all the important aspects about the project. I personally interviewed all developers and leads to get their perspective. Then, we discussed and defined our next steps. In summary, processes for creation, maintainance, structure and ramp-up of new members were designed. As Jira was the tool responsible for tracking our tasks, Confluence was choosen for storing documentation, because both had integration between them.

    </div>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">
Another aspect that had potential for improvement was the interoperability on Bluetooth devices. As mentioned before, this was one of the most common bug scenarios that we had. 
It is rather complicated to address such problem, as despite the protocol, there are many aspects of the communication between central and peripheral that are not enforced by it. Considering that issues with phone and carkit flakiness were often times considered critical, and the increasing development of infotainment systems with Android Automotive OS, a project was started using <a hrefl="https://github.com/snappautomotive/firmware-device_snappautomotive_rpi">AAOS for Raspberry Pi boards</a>. In essence, the main idea was to use that to simulate the peer side of the connection, so adjustments could be done to force scenarios and help us during bug analysis and feature implementations. As AAOS has a lot of similarities with AOSP, making changes on different layers would not be totally new to the developers.

## Moving to Sweden

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/gothenburg.jpeg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="got-img" style="display: flex " width="50%" height="50%">

<div style="text-align: justify">
After working for 4 years in Brazil, I decided to accept a huge challenge and move to Sweden. Sebratec reached out to me, and helped me to find an assignment and get a VISA, as well as cover travel costs. As a Software Engineer consultant I was first assigned to Volvo Cars.
</div>

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/sebrateclogo.jpeg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="sebratec-img" style="display: flex; float: left; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px" width="20%" height="20%">

<div style="text-align: justify">
At Volvo Cars, I was part of the OTA (Over-the-air) and Software Download area. Now working in the automotive industry, I had the chance of learning more about UDS and DoIP protocols. Also, as the current Volvo infotainment systems uses Android Automotive OS, I had the opportunity to contribute given my professional background too. This time it was focused on lower layers, so the development used C++.
<br><br>
This was also the first time that I worked in a environment using SaFE. Besides that, SCRUM was followed in a more strict way. That is, the team had a Scrum Master and Product Owner, whereas in my past experiences the tech leads covered those roles. The Agile Train Release had quarterly product increment plannings, and the usage of story points, stories and features were determined during that time. Obviously there was room for flexibility, as things in technology can change quickly. So bi-weekly meetings happened for refinement purposes.
</div>

<img src="{{ '/assets/img/vcclogo.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="vcclogo-img" style="display: flex; float: right; margin: 20px" width="15%" height="15%">

<div style="text-align: justify">
Another aspect that was different at Volvo was the continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), as many automated tests were executed, especially at gate level, so any modifications had to be approved by them. All tests were based on Behave framework using Python, but they were supposed to be all in Pytest in the future. Therefore, I could learn these testing frameworks as well.
<br><br>
I could not only learn technical skills during my time at Volvo, but also how is the Swedish way of working, as well as familiarize myself with a multicultural team. Not only that, but I also experienced a lot of new stuff in my personal life. Immigrating to a new country is never simple, but I have been enjoying Sweden a lot. So far, I've already had many great experiences!
